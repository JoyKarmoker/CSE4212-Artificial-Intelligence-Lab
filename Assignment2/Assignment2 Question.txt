1. Build a CNN which exactly looks like VGG16. Transfer weights of pre-trained VGG16 to the newly built VGG16.

2. Build a CNN which will look like VGG16, but will not be exactly VGG16 by fulfilling the following conditions
Conditions:
Two architecture from two different students cannot be the same..... By chance if it happens, both students will get -10.
Different students should have different input shape and output shape
Different students should have different number of dense layers and number of neurons in dense layers
Different student should have different number convolution layers in different block
Different students should have different pooling layers or down-sampling techniques
